#The labels in this dataset
functional                = the waterpoint is operational and there are no repairs needed
functional needs repair   = the waterpoint is operational, but needs repairs
non functional            = the waterpoint is not operational

# need to check the balance or imbalance for terget column
# I have to check the percentage of null value.Then i am allowed to take decision.

    2.for 'scheme_name', 'funder', 'installer', 'subvillage',

#Encoding:
​When choosing an encoding method for categorical features, consider the following:
1.Cardinality:
2.Feature Type:
3.Model Requirements
4.Avoiding Bias:


# Date-recoded:
    1. year
    2. month
    3. day
    4. day_of_week
    5. week_number
    6. month_year
    7.Days Since Recorded:The number of days between a row’s date_recorded and a reference date.It quantifies how "recent" each entry is


    #Chi-Squared Tests:
        Presentation Tips
            1.Slide Caption: “All date features show significant relationships with pump status (p-values << 0.05), with binned_days_since_recorded and month_recorded being strongest.”

            2.Highlight: Point to the red line (p=0.05) and note all bars are near zero, confirming strong associations unlike weak Pearson correlations.

            3.Context: Mention chi-squared tests capture categorical dependencies, justifying feature retention.


# Important terms of Chi-squared:
    1.Chi² Statistic: Measures how much the observed data deviate from terget data.A higher value indicates a greater difference.
                      A high χ² statistic indicates a significant association between variables.​

    2. P-value: Represents the probability that the observed association is due to chance.A smaller p-value suggests that the association is                        statistically significant.​

    3. Degrees of Freedom: Related to the number of categories in the variables being tested
#Interpretation from our result:
    1.Statistical Significance:All features have extremely low p-values (much less than 0.05).
    
    2.indicating that there is a statistically significant association between each date-derived feature and the status_group.​
    
    3. Strength of Association:binned_days_since_recorded has the highest Chi² value, suggesting it has the strongest association with status_group                                among the features tested.​


#pumps status distribution by month records
    1.Peak in March:This could indicate a period of increased data collection or reporting
    2. Low Counts in May and June:which might suggest reduced data collection or reporting during this period.
    3. Consistent Reporting in Other Months:Months like January, February, July, and October show relatively consistent numbers, indicating steady                                              data collection.
